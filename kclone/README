A set of very kludgy files I used to step repeat blocks for KiCad PCB.
This is useful when you have multiple instances of a schematic page.
I started by using the annotate feature that produces 1xx 2xx numbering.
Then the first instance should be laid out manually.
The python script goes through the PCB file and moves the parts to the desired spacing.
Warning: very kludgy.
